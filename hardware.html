       Base Computer:

When looking at hardware, it would be near impossible to make specific recommendations, as anything we were to list now will be out of date shortly. Additionally, a large part of picking out the perfect computer is not having any specific piece. Rather, it is finding the best deal on components as near to your ideal as possible. However with that said, there are two specific choices you should try your best to avoid. Those being Macbooks and Chromebooks.

    <p>
       Now If you absolutely require a dirt-cheap laptop, Chromebooks are your cheapest option. However they are notorious for selling your information, essentially little personal data miners. For an additional 50$ or so, you can go from a 200$ Chromebook up to a decent Asus or Acer. Both are good brands if you are looking for all the basic functionality of a laptop.

      The above mentioned laptops will only be considered unsatisfactory if you are engaging in high-end film, graphic design, or gaming. The first two mentioned are typically rather specific purchases, and should be referenced to websites more suited to their respective artistic mediums. As for a high end gaming laptop, you should be looking at strong lenovoâ€™s, such as the IdeaPad line. These will provide for you at a reasonable price.

    <p>
        As for a desktop computer, these are largely unnecessary unless you are looking for a high-end gaming machine. If that is the case, it is highly effective to build your own. Refer to a custom build site should you be interested in such a gaming rig. One rule of thumb to keep in mind is that you should never go with pre-made computers, especially not alienware or similar gaming brands.
